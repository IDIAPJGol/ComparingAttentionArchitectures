# Developing and comparing attention-based architectures for EHR data in terms of discriminability and transparency of attention maps

This GitHub repo presents the architectures developed for the "Use of Attention Maps to Enrich Discriminability in Deep Learning Prediction Models using Longitudinal Data from Electronic Health Records" study by Lucía A. Carrasco-Ribelles, Margarita Cabrera-Bean, Jose Llanes-Jurado, and Concepción Violán.

CodeToRun.py includes all the code needed to validate an example of each type of architecture and obtain their attention maps.
