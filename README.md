# Developing and comparing attention-based architectures for EHR data in terms of discriminability and transparency of attention maps

This GitHub repo presents the architectures developed for the study published in "Carrasco-Ribelles, L. A., Cabrera-Bean, M., Llanes-Jurado, J., & Viol√°n, C. (2025). Use of Attention Maps to Enrich Discriminability in Deep Learning Prediction Models Using Longitudinal Data from Electronic Health Records. Applied Sciences, 15(1), 146. https://doi.org/10.3390/app15010146". Please, cite accordingly.

CodeToRun.py includes all the code needed to validate an example of each type of architecture and obtain their attention maps.
